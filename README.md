# EleFant -- Elegant Fork

_A fork of [Elegant][] for the static site/blog generator [Pelican][]._ I made this custom fork for my personal blog, but I try to keep it generic and flexible enough that other people could use it if they like.

Elegant is released under the [MIT License][], but I don't like that license. All my changes to the code in this fork are licensed GNU GPLv3.
