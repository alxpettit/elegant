# EleFant -- Elegant Fork

_A fork of [Elegant][] for the static site/blog generator [Pelican][]._ I made this custom fork for my personal blog, but I try to keep it generic and flexible enough that other people could use it if they like.

Elegant is released under the [MIT License][], but I don't like that license... so, uh, my changes to the code in this fork are licensed GNU GPLv3. (I highly doubt the Elegant people will be that interested in my tweaks, but of course if they ask I can relicense the modifications to make life easier for them.)
